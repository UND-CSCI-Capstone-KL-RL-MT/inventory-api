# inventory-api
API for our UND inventory system, allowing us to connect to and query the inventory system's database. The inventory API supports GET requests for inventory items and authorized users. It also supports POST requests to add and remove users, add and remove inventory items, and update inventory items.

The repository for the Android application that utilizes this API can be accessed [here](https://github.com/millner09/inventory-android-application).
